## [Unreleased]

### üî• Major Features

#### Participant Profile Management
- **Complete Profile Editing**: Participants can now update their information including name, email, and dietary restrictions
- **Cooking Preference Editor**: Interactive slider to set cooking preferences from "Really dislikes" (-2) to "Loves cooking" (+2)
- **Availability Date Management**: Visual calendar interface to select which trip days they're available
- **Smart Date Selection**: Shows all trip dates with easy "Select All" / "Clear All" options
- **Real-time Validation**: Form validation with proper error handling and user feedback
- **Automatic Schedule Impact**: Changes immediately affect future schedule generation

#### Smart Scheduling Algorithm v2.1 - Hybrid Approach
- **BREAKING**: Completely rebuilt the meal assignment algorithm with sophisticated multi-factor optimization
- **Availability-Based Equity**: Assignments now proportional to participant presence (someone there 2 days vs 10 days gets fair workload distribution)
- **Strategic Skill Matching**: Algorithm pairs cooking enthusiasts (+1,+2 preference) with reluctant cooks (-1,-2) for balanced teams
- **Advanced Temporal Spacing**: Exponential scoring system prevents consecutive assignments and optimizes rest periods (ideal 3-5 day spacing)
- **Global Optimization**: Evaluates all possible team combinations using weighted scoring instead of greedy local decisions
- **Assignment Limits**: Hard caps prevent cooking enthusiasts from being over-assigned (max 60% of total meals)
- **Hybrid Mode Toggle**: "Equal Participation" checkbox allows users to prioritize fairness over skill matching
- **Enhanced Equity Penalties**: Dramatically increased penalties for over-assignment to ensure fair distribution
- **Detailed Logging**: Console output shows decision reasoning and final equity statistics

#### Enhanced Meal Planning Interface
- **Inline Recipe Creation**: Users can now type new recipe names directly in meal planning interface without modal dialogs
- **Streamlined Assignment Flow**: "Create New Recipe" section appears first, with existing recipes below
- **Keyboard Support**: Press Enter in recipe input to instantly create and assign
- **Real-time Feedback**: Toast notifications and loading states for better UX

#### Restored Meal Creation Functionality  
- **Meal Addition in Plan Tab**: Added meal creation interface back to the main Plan tab after schedule tab removal
- **Visual Design**: Green gradient section with clear "Add New Meals" interface

- **docs/api-reference.md**: Comprehensive API endpoint documentation
- **CLAUDE.md**: Concise overview and navigation hub

#### Algorithm Architecture
- **Multi-Phase Processing**: 
  1. Participant analysis and equity calculations
  2. Team combination generation and scoring  
  3. Optimized assignment selection
  4. Database persistence and statistics
- **Scoring System**: Weighted factors for skill (40%), equity (35%), and temporal spacing (25%)
- **Performance Optimization**: Limited team candidate generation to prevent combinatorial explosion
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript types for new algorithm structures

#### API Enhancements
- **Recipe Creation**: Enhanced `/api/recipes` endpoint supports direct meal slot assignment via `mealSlotId` parameter
- **Meal Deletion**: Robust meal removal with automatic cleanup of assignments and recipes
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and validation across all endpoints

#### Database Integration
- **Transaction Safety**: All schedule operations wrapped in database transactions
- **Relationship Management**: Automatic cleanup of related assignments and recipes
- **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper joins and indexing considerations

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Scheduling Issues
- Fixed equity calculation not considering participant availability windows
- Resolved consecutive assignment detection using actual dates instead of slot indices  
- Corrected skill weighting to properly incentivize strategic team composition
- Fixed edge cases with single-participant availability on specific days
- **MAJOR**: Fixed cooking enthusiasts being over-assigned due to skill preference weighting
- Added hard assignment limits to prevent any participant from cooking more than their fair share
- Enhanced equity penalties to ensure balanced distribution regardless of cooking preferences

#### UI/UX Fixes
- Resolved loss of meal creation functionality when schedule tab was removed
- Fixed recipe assignment flow being too complex for quick meal planning
- Corrected meal removal not being available from trip administration
- Fixed inconsistent loading states and error handling across interfaces
- **MAJOR**: Fixed missing participant profile editing - users can now update cooking preferences and availability
- Added proper form validation and error handling for participant updates
- Improved participant page layout with clear edit/view modes

#### Data Consistency
- Ensured proper cleanup of orphaned assignments when meals are deleted
- Fixed recipe assignments not being properly linked to new meals
- Corrected availability date calculations for equity metrics
- Resolved timezone issues in temporal spacing calculations

### üéØ User Experience Improvements

#### Workflow Optimization
- **Faster Recipe Assignment**: Reduced from 3+ clicks to direct typing and Enter key
- **Logical Information Architecture**: Plan tab now contains both meal creation and viewing
- **Intuitive Admin Controls**: Clear deletion options with appropriate safety measures

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to v2.0 Scheduling Algorithm

The new scheduling algorithm is backward compatible but produces different (better) results:

1. **Participant Setup**: Ensure all participants have:
   - Cooking preferences set (-2 to +2 scale)
   - Availability dates configured for fair equity calculations
   
2. **Expected Changes**: 
   - More equitable distribution based on actual availability
   - Better skill balancing in teams
   - Improved temporal spacing between assignments
   
3. **New Features**:
   - Console logging shows scheduling decisions (check server logs)
   - Detailed statistics in API responses
   - Better handling of edge cases (single-participant days, etc.)

### UI Workflow Changes

1. **Meal Creation**: Now located in Plan tab instead of separate Schedule tab
2. **Recipe Assignment**: Can type new recipes directly instead of modal-only creation
3. **Meal Deletion**: Available from Trip Admin page for better organization

No breaking API changes - all existing integrations continue to work.
