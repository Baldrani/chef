## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to TanStack Query Architecture

**BREAKING CHANGE**: All data fetching has been migrated from manual fetch patterns to TanStack Query.

#### Required Changes for Contributors
1. **Import Changes**: Replace manual fetch calls with TanStack Query hooks from `/lib/queries.ts`
2. **Component Updates**: Remove useState loading/error states in favor of built-in query states
3. **Mutation Handling**: Use mutation hooks instead of try/catch blocks with manual error handling
4. **Cache Management**: Leverage automatic query invalidation instead of manual refetch functions

#### Migration Example
```typescript
// ‚ùå Old Pattern - Manual fetch with useState
const [trips, setTrips] = useState([])
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  const loadTrips = async () => {
    setLoading(true)
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/trips')
      const data = await response.json()
      setTrips(data)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error)
    } finally {
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }
  loadTrips()
}, [])

// ‚úÖ New Pattern - TanStack Query
import { useTrips } from '@/lib/queries'

const { data: trips = [], isLoading, error } = useTrips()
```

### Upgrading to Authentication-Required Participant Management

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Anonymous participant creation has been disabled. All users must now authenticate before joining trips.

#### Required Database Migration
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-unique-user-per-trip-constraint
```

#### User Workflow Changes
1. **Shared Links**: All `/join/[token]` links now redirect to `/associate/[token]` requiring authentication
2. **Participant Creation**: Users must sign in before creating participants (Google OAuth required)
3. **Account Linking**: Existing unassociated participants can be claimed by authenticated users
4. **Admin Management**: Trip creators can now see and manage user-participant associations

#### API Changes
- **New Endpoints**: `/api/invites/[token]/participants`, `/api/invites/[token]/associate`, `/api/participants/[id]/disassociate`
- **Enhanced Responses**: Participant queries now include user relationship data
- **Session Requirements**: All association operations require authenticated sessions

#### Navigation Updates
- **Admin ‚Üí Trips**: All references to "Admin" panel renamed to "Trips"
- **New Routes**: `/[locale]/associate/[token]` for authenticated participant selection

### Upgrading to v2.0 Scheduling Algorithm

The new scheduling algorithm is backward compatible but produces different (better) results:

1. **Participant Setup**: Ensure all participants have:
   - Cooking preferences set (-2 to +2 scale)
   - Availability dates configured for fair equity calculations
   
2. **Expected Changes**: 
   - More equitable distribution based on actual availability
   - Better skill balancing in teams
   - Improved temporal spacing between assignments
   
3. **New Features**:
   - Console logging shows scheduling decisions (check server logs)
   - Detailed statistics in API responses
   - Better handling of edge cases (single-participant days, etc.)

### UI Workflow Changes

1. **Meal Creation**: Now located in Plan tab instead of separate Schedule tab
2. **Recipe Assignment**: Can type new recipes directly instead of modal-only creation
3. **Meal Deletion**: Available from Trip Admin page for better organization

No breaking API changes - all existing integrations continue to work.
